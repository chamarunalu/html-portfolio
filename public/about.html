<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey, I’m Chamath Arunalu Wijesundara! I love solving problems and building things with code—whether it’s software, websites, or algorithms.
For me, development isn’t just a job; it’s a hobby I truly enjoy. I like keeping things simple,
both in life and in the solutions I create, making everyday tasks easier through technology.</p>

<p>When I’m not coding, I’m outdoors—hiking, rock climbing, parkour, or practicing outdoor survival skills.
I enjoy pushing my limits and taking on new challenges, just like in development. To stay fit, I do High-Intensity Interval Training
(HIIT) workouts, which keep me strong and energized for both my outdoor adventures and long coding sessions.</p>

<p>I love meeting people from different backgrounds, sharing knowledge, and learning new things.
The best ideas come from great conversations! And if there’s pizza and coffee involved, even better.</p>
